# Simple Python Calculator 🧮

This is a basic command-line calculator built with Python.  
It allows a user to input **two numbers** and choose a **mathematical operation**:  
**addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, or **division**.

## 💡Features

- Accepts user input for numbers and operations.
- Uses Python functions (`def`) to handle each arithmetic operation.
- Handles division by zero gracefully.
- Displays results in a user-friendly format.

## 🚀How to Use

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your system.
2. Download or copy the code into a file named `calculator.py`.
3. Run the program from your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python calculator.py

##Example
mathematica
Copy
Edit
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 5  
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): +  
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

## 📁File Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
calculator.py     # Main program file
README.md         # This file

## 📘Requirements
Python 3.x

🛠️ Future Improvements
Support for more operations (modulus, exponentiation, etc.)

Allow continuous calculations

GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
